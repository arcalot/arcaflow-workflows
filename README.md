# Arcaflow Example Workflows

Workflows created and maintained by the Arcaflow team. The [basic-examples](basic-examples) show how to use particular features of workflows. The [advanced-examples](advanced-examples) provide more real-world use cases.

You can use a cluster local to your machine to functionally test your workflows. See the [local development documentation](docs/local-development.md).
